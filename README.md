# HowTo
In this HowTo repository, i'll write down things, that didnt go as smooth as planned (e.g. installing a program) and what i did, to make it work. This might help someone who has the same issue.
As of writing this, im running on Ubunutu 19.04.

So far, i have the following small HowTo's:

- HowTo install Astah with wrong java-version
- HowTo get pip3 to run
