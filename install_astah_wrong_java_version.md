## "This Java Environment is not supported in Astah."
#### How to install and switch your java-version.

If you havent downloaded Astah yet, you can do it [here](http://astah.net/download). If you're a student, you can get a free license, by clicking "Students - Get Free License" and entering your information. After that, you can download a license-file, which you will need to get the full program. If you are running on Ubunut like me, you're gonna need the Linux<sup>Deb</sup> download.

If you finished downloading and installing Astah and you want to launch it, you might get a message like this:

In that case, you're gonna need to install an older version of java. I decided to install Java 8, so 1 version lower, than what Astah said wouldn't work anymore.

I downloaded Java 8 [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/linux_manual.jsp), choosing the Linux x64 Option. Once downloaded, i followed [these](http://astah.net/qa/setup/linux) instructions.
