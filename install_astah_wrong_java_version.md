Here i'll show you how you can install and switch your java-version, if astah doesn't work.

If you havent downloaded Astah yet, you can do it [here](http://astah.net/download). If you're a student, you can get a free license, by clicking "Students - Get Free License" and entering your information. After that, you can download a license-file, which you will need to get the full program. If you are running on Ubunut like me, you're gonna need the Linux<sup>Deb</sup> download.
